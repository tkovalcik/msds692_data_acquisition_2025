Microparticles were identified in sediment from all 20 sites. Fibers, followed by fragments, were the most abundant type of microparticles in Bay sediment, with detected concentrations ranging between 1 and 49 microfibers per gram dry weight (dw), and between 0.1 and 11 non-fiber microparticles (including fragments, films, spheres, and foams) per gram dw. The highest concentrations of microparticles were measured in Lower South Bay, which is strongly influenced by wastewater and urban stormwater discharges. Concentrations at the reference site, Tomales Bay, were among the lowest observed in the study.  Black fragments that had a rubbery texture were frequently detected in sediment samples.  Spectroscopy was unable to identify the composition; however, based on secondary characteristics, these particles were similar to particles that had been previously identified as rubber by FTIR spectroscopy. These particles were also similar to the black, rubbery fragments that were abundant in stormwater, suggesting that stormwater is an important pathway for microparticles to reach Bay sediment, and that inputs from tire wear and perhaps use of recycled tires (e.g., artificial turf) may also merit further investigation. Microparticle and microplastic concentrations in the Bay sediment were higher than those reported in the majority of other regions around the globe. PREY FISH To evaluate the uptake of microplastics into the food web, two prey fish species, topsmelt and Northern anchovy, were sampled at six sites in the Bay, as well as two sites in a less urban reference area (Tomales Bay).  At each site, approximately 10 fish of each species were collected, and the digestive tracts were analyzed for microparticles and microplastics.  Microparticle levels in fish from San Francisco Bay were higher than levels in fish from Tomales Bay. Fibers were particularly abundant; while most fibers were dyed and therefore produced by people, few could be identified conclusively as plastic. At least 38% of fish from the Bay had consumed microparticles. The estimated average number of microplastics was between 0.2 and 0.9 non-fiber microplastics per fish and between 0.6 and 4.5 plastic fibers per fish. While fibers were detected in all fish from the Bay regardless of species, non-fiber microparticles were more frequently detected in topsmelt compared to anchovies. The microplastic counts and detection frequencies in the Bay were comparable to counts reported in many other locations. '},\n",
       " {214: 'Chapter 6 – Prey Fish \\n   201 Highlights ¨ Northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and topsmelt (Atherinops affinis) were collected at multiple sites in San Francisco Bay and at a reference area with minimal urban influence. Fish guts were digested whole in potassium hydroxide (KOH), filtered through a 10 μm polycarbonate filter, and analyzed for microparticles and microplastics down to 20 μm.  ¨ These two prey fish species were chosen to evaluate whether differences in preferred habitat and foraging behavior affected microparticle concentrations. While there was no statistically significant difference in fiber counts between the two species, there was a statistically significant difference in non-fiber microparticle counts, with topsmelt having higher levels than anchovies.  ¨ Microparticle levels in fish from San Francisco Bay were statistically higher than microparticle levels in fish from the reference area with minimal urban influence (Tomales Bay).  ¨ At least 38% of fish from the Bay had microparticle levels above the threshold for data qualification determined from laboratory blanks. The estimated average number of non-fiber microplastics/fish in Bay anchovies and topsmelt was 0.2–0.9 microplastics/fish. The estimated average number of fiber microplastics/fish in Bay anchovies and topsmelt was 0.6–4.5 microplastics/fish. The microplastic counts in the Bay were comparable to counts reported in many other locations.  ¨ Microfibers were the predominant microparticle morphology in fish samples from the Bay, representing 86% of microparticles present in fish. Of the fibers that were further analyzed via Raman spectroscopy, 23% were confirmed to be plastic, while 60% were classified as anthropogenic unknown because dyes embedded in the microfibers interfered with the laboratory’s ability to identify the composition. Twenty-one percent of non-fiber microparticles analyzed by spectroscopy were confirmed to be plastic.  ¨ Particles smaller than 150 μm represented 16% of fragments and 6% of fibers observed in fish samples. Particles in this size fraction have the potential to translocate out of the gut and bioaccumulate.    '},\n",
       " {215: 'Chapter 6 – Prey Fish \\n   202 Objectives The goal of this element of the San Francisco Bay Microplastics Project was to characterize microparticles and microplastics in the digestive tracts of prey fish collected in and around San Francisco Bay. Microplastics are a subset of microparticles and microfibers that have been definitively determined as plastic through spectroscopy or other means. Many studies in the literature identify microparticles that appear to be plastic using only visual techniques, such as microscopy. In this report, we refer to particles (< 5 mm) identified visually as microparticles; particles that have been confirmed to be plastic through Raman or Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy are referred to as microplastics.  Prey fish may ingest microplastics through passive filtration or active consumption when the microplastics are mistaken for food (Peters et al., 2017). Prey fish are desirable for monitoring microplastic contamination for several reasons. ¨ Prey fish serve as indicators of the bioavailability of microplastics in the environment.  ¨ Prey fish exhibit relatively high site fidelity, allowing for comparisons among subembayments in the Bay. In some cases, correlations can be made between concentrations of contaminants in sediment and concentrations in prey fish, as has been demonstrated for PCBs (Greenfield and Allen, 2013). ¨ Prey fish have short life spans (1–2 years), providing a snapshot of conditions in time. ¨ Prey fish are important food sources for piscivorous fish, birds, and marine mammals, and provide an index of exposure to higher trophic levels.  Anchovies and topsmelt (Table 6.1) are important pelagic prey fish in the Bay food web, and are a key food source for larger predators, including sport fish, marine mammals, and seabirds. Anchovies are the most abundant fish in San Francisco Bay, especially in the higher salinity waters of South Bay (Kimmerer, 2015). Although not as numerous as anchovies, topsmelt have been used as a biosentinel species for monitoring contaminants in the Bay due to their restricted home range, nearshore habitat, and wide distribution throughout the Bay (Greenfield and Jahn, 2010; Greenfield and Allen, 2013). Topsmelt can tolerate a large range of salinities; juveniles are typically in freshwater and move toward saline water as they age. Anchovies and topsmelt also have different feeding habits, providing an opportunity to test the hypothesis that fish at the same trophic level with different foraging strategies ingest different amounts and types of microplastics. Anchovies graze on zooplankton and phytoplankton, crustaceans, fish eggs, and larvae throughout the water column, using a combination of filter-feeding and visual hunting. In contrast, topsmelt tend to graze near the bottom of the water column, and are opportunistic feeders of pelagic invertebrates, diatoms, and plants. '},\n",

Cast nets were primarily used for capturing topsmelt, and otter trawls were primarily used to capture anchovies. Ten fish per species were targeted at each of the eight sites (Figure 6.1). At two sites, the target was not obtained (LSB06 with four anchovies and CB10 with eight topsmelt), resulting in a total sample size of 152 fish. Total length was measured to group fish by size class; then each fish was individually wrapped in foil, placed on ice, and kept at -20°C. Fish were shipped to the University of Toronto on ice. Fish lengths ranged between 4.0–26.5 cm, and mass ranged between 0.4–125.3 g. Fish did not have juvenile markings and were captured in seawater.  '},\n",
       " {221: 'Chapter 6 – Prey Fish \\n   208 Data analysis Hypotheses for microparticle and microplastic contamination in San Francisco Bay fish were evaluated using multiple statistical methods.  1. Fish from reference sites will have lower concentrations of microparticles and microplastics.  This was evaluated by testing whether there were statistically significant differences among microparticle counts in fish from different regions. Because there were more than two groups being compared (i.e., Central Bay, South Bay, reference area—Tomales Bay, and laboratory blanks), a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to evaluate whether groups were different. Once we determined the effect of site was significant, we used Dunn’s pairwise post-hoc test to evaluate differences between all pairwise combinations of the sites and laboratory blanks (adjusted two-sided p-value using the Holm method).  2. An open Bay species (anchovy) will have a different microplastic composition than fish that reside largely in the Bay margins (topsmelt). Specifically, microparticle counts in anchovies will be different from topsmelt.  The distribution of microparticle counts for anchovies and topsmelt were found to be non-normal and heteroskedastic; therefore, we used a Mann-Whitney U Test to assess whether the distribution of microparticle counts was significantly different between topsmelt and anchovies.  Statistical evaluations were considered significant at p < 0.05. Treatment of blanks Laboratory and field blank results are reported alongside field sample results. Reported microparticle counts in field samples were not blank corrected (i.e., blank counts were not subtracted from the field sample counts) due to the non-uniform nature observed in the background field and laboratory contamination. The field and laboratory blanks were used to develop conservative thresholds for data qualification of the average laboratory blank plus two times the standard deviation, below which results are qualified. Qualified values should be treated with caution, because they may be strongly influenced by contamination from processing and analysis. The field and laboratory blank data as well as the threshold values are reported so individual readers can make their own assessment. Average microplastic counts in Bay prey fish are estimated using a lower and upper bound methodology for accounting for procedural contamination through blank correction. '},\n",

Within the Bay, there was no regional difference in microparticle counts in fish from Central Bay compared to South Bay (Figure 6.5). Particle counts in fish within the range measured in laboratory blanks should be treated with caution. While all prey fish from San Francisco Bay contained microparticles, 38% (43 out of 112 fish) contained total microparticle counts (all morphologies combined) above the threshold for data qualification of 14.9, below which laboratory contamination may be a significant component of detected particles. Of the fish samples from the reference area (Tomales Bay), only 10% (4 out of 40 fish) were above the conservative threshold for data qualification. The data qualification threshold for total particles may be considered particularly conservative because it does not account for the variation in blank contamination for different morphologies. When each morphology was considered separately, 67% of Bay fish contained microparticles (anchovies and topsmelt combined, all morphologies combined). \\n Figure 6.5.

Most of the microfiber counts (74 out of 112 fish) were qualified because the fibers per fish were below the conservative threshold for data qualification of 13.6 fibers/sample.

The distribution of microparticles/fish was skewed such that most fish had relatively low microparticles/fish, below the conservative threshold for data qualification, while a limited number of fish had high microparticle counts (Figure 6.5). Most of the data qualifications by morphology were due to the microfiber counts, because the conservative threshold for data qualification for fibers was relatively high (13.6 microfibers/fish). The variability in the number of fibers detected in the laboratory blanks (1–16, n = 15) makes the microfiber counts less definitive. Most of the laboratory blanks did not have non-fiber microparticles, which indicated the non-fiber microparticle counts were most likely less influenced by background contamination. We therefore estimated fibers and non-fiber microplastics separately, and estimated the portion that was microplastics based on the results of the spectroscopic analysis. First, we estimated an upper and lower bound of the average number of microfibers in anchovies and topsmelt after blank correction. The upper-bound estimate was calculated after blank-correcting microfiber counts in both species of fish by the average of the laboratory blanks (5.3 microfibers/sample). The lower-bound estimate was calculated after blank-correcting microfiber counts using the conservative threshold for data qualification (13.6 microfibers/sample). Since not all microfibers are plastic, we then estimated a percentage of the microfibers in anchovies and topsmelt to be plastic based on the composition of fibers that were analyzed by spectroscopy (Tables A-6.3 and A-6.4). An upper-bound estimate of fiber microplastics/anchovy and fiber microplastics/topsmelt was calculated using the percentage of fibers confirmed to be plastic (21% for anchovies and 26% for topsmelt) and assuming 60% of the anthropogenic unknown fibers (62% and 57% of total fibers, respectively; Tables A-6.3 and A-6.4) was also plastic. The estimate of 60% of anthropogenic unknown fibers as plastic was based on the industry estimate that approximately 60% of textiles today are made from nylon and polyester (Almroth et al. 2018). The lower bound uses only the percentage of particles confirmed to be plastic. We also estimated an upper and lower bound of the average number of non-fiber microparticles in anchovies and topsmelt. The upper-bound estimate was calculated by blank-subtracting particle counts of each morphology using the average of the blanks for each morphology, and summing the average of the resulting microparticle counts for each '},\n",

The lower-bound estimate was calculated by blank-subtracting particle counts using the conservative threshold for data qualification for each morphology. The amount of microplastics was estimated from the microparticle averages based on the estimated percentage of plastics using a similar methodology as described above for fibers. The upper-bound estimate used the percentage of microparticles confirmed to be plastic and half of the percentage of particles identified as anthropogenic unknown for each morphology. The lower-bound estimate used only the percentage of particles confirmed to be plastic (Tables A-6.3 and A-6.4).  The resulting estimates of the average number of fiber microplastics in anchovies and topsmelt are 0.6–4.3 microplastics/anchovy and 0.9–4.5 microplastics/topsmelt (Table 6.3). The fiber microplastic estimates are blank-corrected as described above. The resulting estimates of the average number of non-fiber microplastics in anchovies is 0.2–0.4 microplastics/anchovy, and the estimate for average in topsmelt is 0.4–0.9 microplastics/topsmelt (Table 6.3).  The resulting estimates of the average number of fiber microplastics in anchovies and topsmelt were 0.6–4.3 microplastics/anchovy and 0.9–4.5 microplastics/topsmelt (Table 6.3).

       " {240: 'Chapter 6—Prey Fish \\n   227 The detection frequency of microfibers and non-fiber microparticles in San Francisco Bay anchovies and topsmelt, taking into account only microparticle counts above the conservative data qualification threshold , appeared to be within the range reported in other studies. Studies that report high detection frequencies observed mostly fibers (Anastasopoulou et al., 2018; Jabbeen et al., 2017), and it is unclear whether blank contamination was measured or subtracted from reported counts. Jabeen et al. (2017) observed microparticles in the digestive tract of 100% of marine fish and 95.7% of freshwater fish they sampled. They also observed a high abundance of larger particles; 70.9% of marine fish and 43.5% of freshwater fish contained items that appeared to be plastic with dimensions between 5 and 25 mm. These findings may be due to high plastic loads in marine waters near the major city of Shanghai (Isobe et al., 2015) where these fish were caught. Although Jabeen et al. (2017) reported low blank contamination (0.25 ± 0.05 items/filter) and FTIR polymer identification of a subset of microparticles, it is unclear from their reporting whether blank contamination was subtracted from reported microplastics in fish and whether numbers account for the percentage of microparticles confirmed to be plastic. The detection frequencies found in our study are conservative because we only included values above a conservative threshold for data qualification.  Most other studies also reported an average of less than one microplastic/fish when fibers were not included, which is consistent with non-fiber microplastics estimates in San Francisco Bay. An exception to this was Avio et al. (2015), who reported an average of greater than one microplastic/fish (1.6–1.8 microplastics/fish) in the Adriatic Sea, but the average was calculated only for fish with detectable particles (excluding non-detects). Upper-bound estimates of average non-fiber microplastics/fish in San Francisco Bay were similar when only such positive values were counted after blank correction. Also, it is not clear in other studies whether reported microparticle abundances account for particles that were confirmed to be plastic.  The abundance of fibers seen in San Francisco Bay was also within the range reported in other studies. Anastasopoulou et al. (2018) reported higher average fiber abundances, including the abundances reported in gilthead seabream and golden grey mullet from the Slovenian Sea. However, it is unclear whether blank contamination was subtracted from reported counts. Fibers from the present study were likely undercounted \\n'},\n",
       " {241: 'Chapter 6—Prey Fish \\n   228 since white and clear fibers were not included. Recent reports of microplastics in fish from the Pearl River catchment in China indicated that transparent polyester fibers were the predominant type of microplastic debris in fish guts (Zheng et al., 2019). It is not possible to determine whether the fish from San Francisco Bay would have similar compositions of clear plastic fibers, had blank contamination been less significant. Several of the comparative studies (Table 6.4) lacked polymer identification, which may lead to erroneous characterization of microplastics; it is also not clear in other studies that used spectroscopy for polymer identification how plastic confirmations were used to estimate microparticle and microplastic abundances and detection frequencies. Therefore, our method of estimating microplastics based on the percentage of microparticles confirmed to be plastic may be more conservative than other studies. Another consideration is that we used a smaller filter size (10 μm) compared with many other studies; we were able to count smaller microparticles, likely increasing total counts somewhat. Two of the studies with the lowest microparticle counts in fish used filters with pore sizes of 200 μm or greater (Baalkhuyur et al., 2018; Rochman et al., 2015). However, our quantification of smaller particles may not have had a large effect on counts, as only 7% of the particles in the present study (16% of fragments and 6% of fibers) were in the smallest (<150 μm) size class (Figure 6.3). San Francisco Bay fish appeared to ingest mostly fibers and fragments, which is consistent with the microparticles found in fish digestive tracts in other studies around the world. This is likely due to the relatively high proportion of these morphologies compared to spheres, films, and foams in marine and estuarine water and sediment, including in the Bay. Comparison between Bay species indicate differences The two prey fish species chosen for this study were selected because of the differences in their foraging characteristics, which may lead to differences in microparticle ingestion. Topsmelt are thought to reside closer to Bay margins, shallow areas, and benthic areas, as compared to anchovies that generally live and feed in deeper Bay channels and throughout the water column.  While there was no significant difference in total microparticle counts between the two species, this was mainly driven by the variability in the fiber counts. There was a statistical difference in non-fiber microparticle counts between the two species; topsmelt had higher levels of non-fiber microparticles. The median number of microparticles in anchovies was zero compared to 1.5 microparticles/fish in topsmelt. Most of the microparticles could not be identified by polymer type due to interference of embedded dyes with the Raman spectroscopy. Topsmelt may be exposed to higher levels of microparticles and microplastics in sediment and margin areas, their preferred '},\n",

However, due to methodological differences in how sediment and fish samples were analyzed, we could not evaluate whether topsmelt concentrations were correlated with sediment concentrations, and whether higher concentrations in topsmelt compared to anchovies may be explained by topsmelt preferences for areas with higher levels of microplastics. Peters et al. (2017) reported that a benthic-foraging grunt species had lower microplastic ingestion rates than the other species measured. The authors suggested that the grunt was a more selective benthic invertebrate feeder and therefore less likely to ingest microplastics compared to a generalist. Lusher et al. (2013) did not find a significant difference in microplastic levels in sampled pelagic and demersal species. Likewise, in an extensive survey of 2,233 fish from 69 species in two Brazilian estuaries, Vendel et al. (2017) found that microplastic ingestion occurred irrespective of fish size, functional group, and feeding guild.  Particles detected in fish may potentially translocate and cause adverse impacts  There are mixed reports of microplastic effects on fish (Foley et al., 2018). Many studies report minimal effects, even when fish were exposed to relatively high doses of microplastics (Ašmonaitė et al., 2018a, 2018b; Caruso et al., 2018; Foley et al., 2018; Jacob et al., 2019; Jovanović et al., 2018; LeMoine et al., 2018; Malinich et al., 2018; Messinetti et al., 2019; Tosetto et al., 2017). However, other studies report a variety of adverse effects, including inflammation and oxidative stress (Brandts et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2018; Romano et al., 2018), microbiome changes (Jin et al., 2018), altered swimming and feeding behavior (Barboza et al., 2018; Critchell and Hoogenboom, 2018; Mattsson et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2018), altered reproductive success (Peixoto et al., 2019; Pitt et al., 2018), and decreased growth and body condition (Barboza et al., 2018; Critchell and Hoogenboom, 2018; Jabeen et al., 2018). The \\n'},\n",
       " {243: 'Chapter 6—Prey Fish \\n   230 discrepancy may be due to differences in species and microplastics (shape; size; polymer; virgin or weathered; associated contaminants—including additives, sorbed chemicals, and microorganisms), and whether the microplastic exposure occurred alone or in conjunction with exposure to other contaminants. Irregularly shaped microplastics (fragments and fibers), especially those that have experienced environmental weathering, are more likely to cause adverse effects than virgin particles (Choi et al., 2018; Jabeen et al., 2018). Microplastics also seem to increase the accumulation and toxicity of other environmental contaminants, including heavy metals (Barboza et al., 2018; Rainieri et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2018), persistent organic pollutants (Pannetier et al., 2019a, 2019b; Rainieri et al., 2018), and emerging contaminants (Chen et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019). Microplastics can also act as a vector for pathogens (Viršek et al., 2017). Smaller microparticles tend to cause more adverse effects (Critchell and Hoogenboom, 2018; Ding et al., 2018; Mattsson et al., 2017), possibly because they can more easily translocate from the gut into the bloodstream and other tissues (Ding et al., 2018; Mattsson et al., 2017; Messinetti et al., 2019), including maternal transfer to embryos (Pitt et al., 2018). While most microplastics (greater than 90%) ingested by fish will be excreted (Lusher et al., 2017), they may bioaccumulate if they translocate across the gut and into the tissues of the animal (Browne et al., 2008). Reports vary as to what size of microplastics may translocate across the gut epithelium. Lusher et al. (2017) suggest that only microparticles smaller than 150 μm may translocate, and only microplastics smaller than 20 μm may penetrate organs. In another study on polyethylene microplastics, researchers found that 80% of exposed anchovies had microplastics in their livers, with sizes ranging from 125 to 438 μm (Collard et al., 2017). Additionally, Avio et al. (2015) found that microplastics between 200 and 600 μm translocated into the liver of mullets.  Based on the hypothesis that microparticles smaller than 150 μm may translocate, in this study, a total of 30 fragments (16% of total fragments) and 98 fibers (6% of total fibers) could potentially translocate (Figure 6.3). A more protective approach would use the higher estimate that microparticles up to 600 μm have been found to translocate. A total of 39% of fragments and 80% of fibers from this study were smaller than 500 μm. The smallest microparticle observed was a fragment 24 μm in width. These smaller microparticles were not targeted in Bay surface water samples (355 μm net size), sediment samples (125 μm sieve), or in wastewater and stormwater samples (125 μm sieve). Identifying very small microparticles in future studies will be important to understanding the potential impacts of microparticles on Bay fish.  '},\n",
       " {244: 'Chapter 6—Prey Fish \\n   231 Conclusions This study sought to quantify the abundance of microplastics in prey fish, characterize the type and chemical composition of microparticles found in prey fish, identify sites or regions of particular concern, and compare the results with other studies. While all prey fish from San Francisco Bay contained microparticles, only 38% had total microparticle counts greater than 14.9 microparticles/fish, a conservative data quality threshold below which laboratory contamination may be a significant component of detected microparticles. While there was no statistically significant difference in the abundance of fibers detected in Bay fish by species, non-fiber microparticles were more frequently detected, and at higher levels, in topsmelt compared to anchovies. Prey fish from San Francisco Bay had statistically higher total microparticle counts compared to the reference area with minimal urban influence (Tomales Bay).  The composition of microparticles counted in San Francisco Bay fish samples was 86% fibers, 11% fragments, and 3% films. While most microparticles could not be positively identified based on polymer type (unknown category), 23% of fibers that underwent spectroscopy were positively identified as plastic and 11% were natural-based. For non-fiber microparticles that underwent spectroscopy, 20% were confirmed to be plastic and 4% were natural-based.  The estimated averages of fiber and non-fiber microplastics per fish were calculated separately because the variability of fibers in the blank samples, as well as the exclusion of white and clear fibers from counts, makes the microfiber counts less definitive than the non-fiber microplastic counts. The estimated average number of non-fiber microplastic counts in the Bay fish was 0.2–0.9 microplastics/fish, and the estimated average of fiber microplastic counts was 0.6–4.5 microplastics/fish. Based on the incidence of microplastics in the prey fish studied, it is likely that higher trophic organisms such as sport fish and humans are exposed to microplastics through the food web.  The estimated range of average microplastics in Bay prey fish guts are within the ranges observed in most other studies. Some methodological differences made comparisons difficult; the present study used polymer identification to estimate the proportion of microparticles that were microplastics, while several other studies did not include polymer identification or did not clearly explain how polymer identification was used to estimate microplastic abundances. Additionally, the present study used a smaller filter size than most other studies, which may increase counts, while in contrast, the exclusion of white and clear fibers likely resulted in decreased counts.
